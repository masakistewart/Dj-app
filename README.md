V3 of this ongoing project of mine.


Started working on this project back in February of 2015 and have kept updating it with the new skills I aquire.
It is currently is built only with front end frameworks: Angular, Bootstrap. I plan to keep updating this project
every couple of weeks as I continue to learn.

*Things still to be done
  - SoundCloud via soundcloud api
  - Email collection
  - clean up Angular folder and split up all the the 
    controllers separate modules.
  - cleanup code
  - carousel improvements
